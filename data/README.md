# Dataset Overview

The dataset includes experiments on Li-Ion batteries, where charging and discharging were performed at different temperatures. The impedance was recorded as the damage criterion. The dataset is sourced from the [NASA Prognostics Center of Excellence (PCoE) Data Set Repository](https://www.nasa.gov/intelligent-systems-division/discovery-and-systems-health/pcoe/pcoe-data-set-repository/).
